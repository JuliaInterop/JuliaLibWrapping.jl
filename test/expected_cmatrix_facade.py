"""cmatrix_demo idiomatic façade.

This file is generated **once** by JuliaLibWrapping as a starter
façade. Functions whose arguments and return are all recognized
(primitives, `CArray{T,N}`, `CString`, direct `JLWStatus`)
are wrapped to accept and return idiomatic Python objects (numpy
arrays, `str`). Anything else is re-exported from `_lowlevel`
with a `TODO` comment naming what needs hand-wrapping.

Edit this file freely — JuliaLibWrapping will never overwrite it
on subsequent runs. Delete it to regenerate.

The mechanical bindings live in `_lowlevel.py` and are regenerated
on every `write_wrapper` call.
